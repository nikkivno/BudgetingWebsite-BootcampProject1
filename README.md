# BudgetingWebsite-BootcampProject1

## Description

We were tasked with our first group project.
We have chosen to code:

Our project will centre around a budgeting calendar with the user being able to input reoccurring and singular expenses that will display on a monthly calendar spread, accompanied by a pie chart that can open up to a modal display that shows spent income and on what and remaining funds for the month.

Potential APIs to use:
- Google Calendar API (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com?authuser=2&project=encoded-source-389221)
