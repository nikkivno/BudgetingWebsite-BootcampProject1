# BudgetSense

## Description

We were tasked with our first group project.
We have chosen to code:

Our project will centre around a budgeting calendar with the user being able to input reoccurring and singular expenses that will display on a monthly calendar spread, accompanied by a pie chart that can open up to a modal display that shows spent income and on what and remaining funds for the month.

APIs Used:
- Google Calendar API (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com?authuser=2&project=encoded-source-389221)
- D3api Pie Chart API ( https://d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html ) 


What We learned during the project.
- How to Read API documentation.
- How to work on a team.
- How to use branches.
- How to work with team members coding variations. 
- How to add css animation.  

We followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.
